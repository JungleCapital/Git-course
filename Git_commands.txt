Here I will save the commands learn

1. git switch - this swichs between branches 
2. git branch - shows the existing branches
3. git branch + name - creates new branch
4. git commint -m - it commits and write the comment in one go
5. git commit -a -m - it adds to commit and write the comment in one go
    
    Note: for "git commit -a -m" to work the new file has to be added 
    first and then if a new change is made it will work

6. git commit --amend - will re-save the last commit with new changes 
   if made
    
    Note: the file in which changes were made has to bee added again 
    with git add "name of file" then we can use git commit --amend 

7. git log - will log all commits
8. git lot --oneline - will show all commits with notes in one line
9. git switch -c - it will create a new branch and switch all in one go
