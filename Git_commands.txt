Here I will save the commands learn

1. git switch - this swichs between branches 
2. git branch - shows the existing branches
3. git branch + name - creates new branch
4. git commint -m - it commits and write the comment in one go
5. git commit -a -m - it adds to commit and write the comment in one go
    
    Note: for "git commit -a -m" to work the new file has to be added 
    first and then if a new change is made it will work

6. git commit --amend - will re-save the last commit with new changes 
                        if made
    
    Note: the file in which changes were made has to bee added again 
    with git add "name of file" then we can use git commit --amend 

7. git log - will log all commits
8. git log --oneline - will show all commits with notes in one line

9. git switch -c - it will create a new branch and switch all in one go
10. touch - it creates new files
11. mkdit - will create new directories
12. git branch -d - will delete a branch but you don't have to be 
                    in that branch and it has to be fully merged
13. git branch -D - it will forece to delete the branch even if is
                    not merged
14. git branch -m - will rename the branch you are in
15. git merge + branch name - it merges branch, but we must be in
                    the receiving branch
16. git branch -v - it shows the branchs with the last commits notes
