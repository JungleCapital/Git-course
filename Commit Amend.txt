Here I write down how to fix the last commit in case I forgot to
include a file to the last commit

To do so we use git commit --amend
This will fix just the last commit, steps below

we first add the forgotten file 
git add "here name of file"

then we use 
git commit --amend

and that is it, now the file i forgot to add was added to the last commit
IT DID NOT CREATE A NEW COMMIT
